# Yeti-Analytics- Sentiment analysis 
This project analyses review data from various sources and formats to identify the underlying cause of drastic changes in room sales for Yeti Hotels. By conducting sentiment analysis on the review data, the Yeti Analytics team hopes to gain insights into customer satisfaction and identify any issues that may have led to the decline in sales. The value of this project lies in its potential to provide Yeti Travel with actionable insights that can be used to improve customer satisfaction and increase sales. By identifying the factors that are negatively impacting sales, Yeti Travel can take targeted action to address these issues and improve their offerings. Additionally, this project demonstrates the value of data analytics and the importance of having a dedicated analytics team to manage and analyse data for business insights.
To analyse the sentiment of review data collected from various sources and provide insights on the changes in sales of rooms in the current quarter.
Solution: I’ve used Machine learning and deep learning technologies to solve this. I’ve used these technologies in python programming. I did exploratory data analysis by using python and then build the models on the data. This analysis will provide insights into customers' perceptions and opinions about Yeti Travels' services, amenities, and experiences. The analysis will be conducted using natural language processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning models.
The code snippet begins with the definition of a create_sentiment function that assigns sentiment labels to each review based on the corresponding ratings. Ratings of 1 or 2 are classified as negative sentiments, while ratings of 4 or 5 indicate positive sentiments, and other ratings are considered neutral.
Subsequently, the TfidfVectorizer from the scikit-learn library is used to convert the textual reviews into a numerical format suitable for machine learning. The vectorizer is configured to strip accents, retain the original case, and not apply any pre-processing. The resulting feature matrix X represents the transformed textual data.
The dataset is then split into training and testing sets using the train_test_split function from scikit-learn. The target variable y contains the sentiment labels created using the create_sentiment function. The Logistic Regression model is instantiated with the 'liblinear' solver and trained on the training data.
The predict method is applied to the test data, yielding predicted sentiment labels in the preds array. The code thus showcases the application of preprocessing, vectorization, model training, and prediction for sentiment analysis.
